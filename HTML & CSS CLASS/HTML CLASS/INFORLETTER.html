 <h3>Dear Victor,</h3>
<h4 style="margin-left: 50px;">How are you? How you doing? I hope all is going smooyhly? How was Daddy and Mummy? What about my younger ones,hope all is well with them?</h4>
 <h4>
     <p>My purpose of writting this leter to you was to tell you my journey so far at SQI College of ICT Ogbomoso Campus. Wow! to begin with,I heared about this tech school on Radio. I was so amazed the first day i hear about it through a programme with Dr.Adeyemi Aderinto. I always enjoys the programme on Parrot fm station by 10am. He talked about the school and how some students had passed through it to become someone in life.
      </p>
<p>So i also think of it and consult it with my parents about it,they were also happy about it and them join hands with me by helping me with funds and also guiding and advicing me. Not quiet long,we started processing it bygoing to their branch at Opposite YOACO,Beside LAUTECH UNIVERSITY Ogbomoso,oyo state. Then we meet with the admin and she explains all the courses been offered their,then when have already through with my secondary school,I have to apply for a course. In the process i was told a Diploma certificate is been offered there,so i applied for it. I'm now an 100L student at the school now. And in Software Department with my course of Web Developer. So i have gained admission since last month and started some courses as like been in university. I have always enjoyed all the classes so far and SQI as a whole as improved me in handling a PC[computer]. I've really loved been there.</p>
<p> We started the class today as the peofessional for been a web developer but we had a programme today called "Mind Talk" which happens every 1st Monday of the months. Today which is September edition topic is  VENTURE CAPITALS,what we should know before raising funds for business. We talk about the type of investments which are;personal investments,family and friends,grants funding,angel investments and then venture capitals. I really gain a lot from the mind talk. So,after the program,we went to our different department to start today's lecture. The name of our instructor is Mr.Oluwaseyi and he is also our HOD[Head of Department]. Then he introduce to us what HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT means. And then we started with HTML and the class was so wonderful and interesting. Part of the work have done with coding with HTML is the letter have just written to you bro.</p>
<p>So am advicing you to make an attempt and convince your parents to come to this coding school and i know we shall all make it and be successful in life. My regards to the family and the younger one's. And how was life moving there? Prayed God will help us all in Jesus name[Amen]. Thanks </p>
<h4 style="width: 200px;margin-left: 1000px;"> Yours faithfully, OLUWAPELUMI.</h4>
